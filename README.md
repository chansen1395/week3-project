## Description

_{This webpage has been created to explore boolean logic and branching, as well as using forms to receive input from the user. The input is tabulated and run through a series of logical arguments to determine the highest score or whether there are any ties. The results are then displayed for the user. A brief description of the language and external links are supplied with the results. Once it is running, answer each of the seven questions in sequence. After results are displayed, you can press the blue "Reset" button at the bottom to start over.}_
